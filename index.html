            <h2 id="#aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born on February 18 2000. I was born in Fresno California. I only have one hobby and that is reading. I love reading because it is my escape where I can forget about everything and everyone. My family is one of the craziest and will be the weirdest people you will ever meet. My granny is 56 years old and all she tells are dirty jokes. Even though my family may seem like they do not care about you deep down they are wondering what is wrong.</p>
                <p>I do not have a dream vacation. My dream is to travel the world and learn about different cultures and help solve the poverty around the world.  I would love to visit Australia because every time I read about it in books the writers make it feel like a wonderland. The downside is that I do not want to travel the world or go to Australia without somebody I love by my side. So my dreams have to stay on hold until I find that person.</p>
